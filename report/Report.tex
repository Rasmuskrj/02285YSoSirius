\section{Bibliography}
Your bibliography should be formatted using \texttt{aaai.bst} as this document. Citations are included like so~\cite{book2015}. Multiple citations appear like this~\cite{conf,article}. All references to be cited should be included in BibTeX format in the file \texttt{bibliography.bib}.\footnote{Almost anything ever published can be found in BibTeX format via Google Scholar, but if using this method, you need to check the BibTeX entry for sanity before including it in the \texttt{bibliography.bib} file.}
