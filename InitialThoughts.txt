Use multiagent approach.

Design an agent the is able to solve a single agent level decently. Refine this agent with communication assets and evolve it into a multi agent system.

We need good heuristics, better than Manhatten distance. Do we want to rely on heuristics on do we want to rely more on hierarchical planning?

We probably want to do online planning, since we plan on doing multi-agent. Do we want to do plan merging? Initial thoughts is no.
