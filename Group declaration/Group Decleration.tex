\section{Work distribution}
This group originally consisted of the members: Rasmus Kr{\o}yer J{\o}rgensen - s090487, Bogdan Sorlea - s121075 and Simon Jensen - s146896. However Simon Jensen has not contributed in any way at all to the project so we have chosen to omit him as author to our report.

Everything in the project, both code, research and report, have been contributed to precisely equally by Rasmus Kr{\o}yer J{\o}rgensen and Bogdan Sorlea. That is that they can each be attributed to 50\% of everything.
